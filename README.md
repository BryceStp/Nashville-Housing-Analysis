# Notes:
1. This is a straight forward project in SQL where we clean up the data and make it a little more useable and then visualize the data set in Power BI.
2. We fill in a few NULL values using locations that have the same ParcelId, but different uniqueIDs, but there are some NULL values we can't do much about (i.e. We cant populate them the same way we did previously), so we will just filter these out in Power BI.
